Introduction

The FrencEinSHteinList class is a Java implementation of a doubly-linked list designed for sorted storage of generic elements. This linked list allows for efficient insertion and sorting of elements based on their values.
Usage

To use the FrencEinSHteinList class in your Java project, follow these steps:

    Include the FrencEinSHteinList.java file in your project.

    Create an instance of FrencEinSHteinList by calling its constructor:

    java

    FrencEinSHteinList<Type> list = new FrencEinSHteinList<>();

    You can now use the various methods provided by the FrencEinSHteinList class to manipulate and work with the list.

Class Overview

The FrencEinSHteinList class extends FrencEinShtein<T> and is designed for sorted linked list implementation. It includes the following key fields:

    head: Reference to the head (first) node of the list.
    tail: Reference to the tail (last) node of the list.
    minNum: Reference to the node with the minimum value in the list.
    maxNum: Reference to the node with the maximum value in the list.
    size: The number of elements in the list.

Methods
Public Methods

    Insert(Node<T> node): Inserts a node into the sorted linked list.
    Print(boolean queue): Prints the elements of the list in the specified order.
    PrintSort(boolean sort): Prints the elements of the list in sorted order.
    Insert(int index, Node<T> node): Inserts a node at a specific index.
    IsEqual(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if two lists are equal.
    IsNotEqual(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if two lists are not equal.
    IsGreatOrNO(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if the list is greater than or equal to another list.
    IsGreatOrEqual(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if the list is greater than or equal to another list.
    IsLowOrNo(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if the list is less than or equal to another list.
    IsLowOrEqual(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Checks if the list is less than or equal to another list.
    Copy(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list): Copies the contents of another list.
    Erase(int index, int count): Removes elements from the list.
    Size(): Returns the number of elements in the list.
    Front(): Returns the first element in the list.
    Back(): Returns the last element in the list.
    PushBack(Node<T> node): Inserts a node at the end of the list.
    PushFront(Node<T> node): Inserts a node at the beginning of the list.
    EmplaceFront(int count): Inserts a specified number of nodes at the beginning of the list.
    PopBack(): Removes the last element from the list.
    PopFront(): Removes the first element from the list.
    ReSize(int count): Resizes the list to contain a specified number of elements.
    Merge(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list2): Merges the current list with another list.
    Swap(FrencEinSHteinList<T> list1, FrencEinSHteinList<T> list2): Swaps the contents of two lists.
    Reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the list.
    Unique(): Removes duplicate elements from the list.
    Sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
    Remove(int index): Removes an element at a specific index.
    Remove(Node<T> node): Removes a specific node from the list.
    Clear(): Clears all elements from the list.
    Empty(): Checks if the list is empty.
